## Here we can define any tables in our database, which are mapped to topics for real-time
## communication. This example shows how we define a type as a table using
## the type name as the table name and specifying it is an "export" available to
## MQTT, REST and other external protocols.
type Topic @table @export {
    id: ID @primaryKey # Here we define primary key (must be one)
    name: String @indexed
    category: String
}
